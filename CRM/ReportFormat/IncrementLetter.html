        <p>Dear Mr./Ms. @@ComHeadName@@:</p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
            This letter is your official notification that effective @@IncrementDate@@, your base salary will increase from <b>@@IncrementSalary@@</b>.
            Check with Human Resources to determine what the amount of your paycheck will be based on the deductions and other
            elections that you have chosen.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
            As I mentioned during Tuesday’s meeting, you are receiving this salary increase because you accomplished the goals
            we had set for this year. Additionally, your contribution has increased due to your focus on continuing to develop
            your leadership skills.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
            The accomplishments of the marketing team that you led were noteworthy. Your campaign for the new product release
            was one of the most comprehensive and successful in our history of product launches.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
            You were also able to add elements of social media and word-of-mouth marketing to the actual product which is a new
            strategy for our company. You are currently collecting data and measuring the success of the campaign which is also
            a first for our marketing group.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
            This is a well-deserved salary increase. I want to personally thank you for all of this but also for your steadfast
            loyalty and commitment to our company’s success. It is appreciated.
        </p>
